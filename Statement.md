> Lead of +1:The text shifts to Magenta, indicating a slight advantage.
>
> Lead of +2:The text shifts to Light Magenta, reinforcing the lead.
>
> Lead of +3 or more:The text shifts to Blue, representing a commanding
> victory state.

The Losing Spectrum (Red Shift)

Conversely, when the computer gains the upper hand, the interface adopts
"hot" colors to signal danger or urgency:

> Deficit of -1:The text shifts to Yellow, serving as a warning.
>
> Deficit of -2:The text shifts to Light Red, indicating imminent loss.
>
> Deficit of -3 or more:The text shifts to Red, representing a critical
> failure state.
